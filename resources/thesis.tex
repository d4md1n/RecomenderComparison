\paragraph{} My supervisor Dimosthenis Kyriazis for totally supporting me in the choices I made and giving me the freedom I was needing.

\paragraph{} My friend and fellow student Dimitris Poulopoulos for helping me understand the field of recommender systems and supported me technically and theoretically.

\paragraph{} My friends and colleagues George Adamopoulos and Nikos Silvestros for constantly teaching me high-level engineering and scientific thinking. Also, I would like to thank them for putting the right amount of pressure on me in order to complete this thesis.

\paragraph{} Kronos, the development team I am part of and helping me to keep my spirit high. Thank you, Apostolos Chissas, Kostas Rigas, Peter Lengos, Vasiliki Giamarelou, Maria Karkeli, Eleni Karakizi, Spyros Argyroiliopoulos, Nikos Anagnostou and Ioannis Koutsileos.
